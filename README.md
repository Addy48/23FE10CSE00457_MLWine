This repository contains the implementation of Machine Learning Laboratory experiments conducted as part of the Machine Learning Lab (CSE3231) curriculum. The experiments are implemented in Python using Google Colab. The Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used as the base dataset for all experiments.
Dataset Description

The Wine Quality dataset consists of physicochemical properties of Portuguese Vinho Verde wine samples.
The goal is to analyze and understand the relationship between chemical attributes and perceived wine quality.

Datasets Used:

winequality-white.csv

winequality-red.csv

Total Features: 11 (real-valued)

Target Variable: quality (integer score between 0 and 10)

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

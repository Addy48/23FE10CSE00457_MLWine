This repository contains the implementation of Machine Learning Laboratory experiments conducted as part of the Machine Learning Lab (CSE3231) curriculum at Manipal University Jaipur.

All experiments are implemented in Python using Google Colab, following the official lab lecture plan.
The Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used as the base dataset for all experiments.

📊 Dataset Description

The Wine Quality dataset consists of physicochemical properties of Portuguese Vinho Verde wine samples.
The objective is to analyze and model the relationship between chemical attributes and perceived wine quality.

winequality-red.csv

🔹 Dataset Details

Total Features: 11 (real-valued)

Target Variable: quality (integer score between 0 and 10)

Task Type: Regression and Classification

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
